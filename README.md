# Open source tracker and analyzer

Tracks activity of open source projects and analyzes it. 

##Goal

####Motivation
We want to understand how much do social companies rely on open source projects and what is the overall impact of external (to the company/project) colaborations in the projects. As a byproduct, we want to stablish a platform that will allow cohort comparisons of external collaborations in open source projects.

####Technical
The goal is to fetch data of changes in open source projects in real time. The fetched data is stored and exposed through an open restful API. The data will also be manipulated and analysed and plotted with a data visualization tool.  

##Scope
Initially, the data will be fetched from public repos in github. In the future, the code can be extended to feature other online version control systems.
